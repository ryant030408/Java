# Unbound Int Class

* The UnboundedInt class will contain four instance variables, the number of Nodes, 
link to front of list, link to back of list, and a cursor which will transverse the list pointing to any nodes.  

* Although you can store the representation of your numbers in either way, 
it makes more sense if you do the lower value terms at the front of the list.   
For example, to represent the number 12,453,075 you would put a 75 in the first Node, then a 
453 in the second and a 12 in the third.  This order will help you when you are attempting to add or 
multiply two numbers of unknown length.
